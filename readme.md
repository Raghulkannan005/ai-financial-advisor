### **2. AI-Powered Financial Advisor**

#### **Aim**  
To develop an app that helps users analyze their expenses and provides AI-driven financial advice to improve savings and achieve financial goals.

#### **Algorithm**  
1. Fetch user financial data via manual input or an API like Plaid.  
2. Categorize expenses (e.g., food, utilities, travel) using AI/ML libraries or APIs.  
3. Generate a monthly expense report.  
4. Provide personalized tips (e.g., “Reduce dining out to save $200/month”).  
5. Set and track financial goals with visual progress indicators.  

#### **Code**  
Main Components:  
1. Expense Tracker: Input or fetch expenses and categorize them.  
2. Analytics: Use Chart.js for spending breakdowns.  
3. Financial Tips: AI generates suggestions using OpenAI or GPT APIs.  
4. Goal Tracker: Track savings and spending goals.  

Key Libraries:  
- `Plaid API` for financial data (optional).  
- `react-chartjs-2` for visualizing expense data.  
- `openai` for generating financial advice.

#### **Output**  
- Dashboard with expense categories, monthly spending, and saving trends.  
- AI-generated recommendations like cutting specific expenses or setting budgets.  
- Financial goal tracker with progress visualization.
